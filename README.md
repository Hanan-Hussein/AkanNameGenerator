## Description

This is a website that calculates a person's Akan Name based on the day of the week they were born. It takes the birthdate and gender as the input and in return it displays the Akan Name. The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These Akan names signify the day one is born.
